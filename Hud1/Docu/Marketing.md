Anything unclear?

GUD - Gaming HUD is a windows application.
It acts as a Head-Up-Display and renders on top of all Games and Application Windows.

It comes with the folling main gaming features:
- Gamma Correction: Increase the windows display gamma to increase contrast in dark situations (like during night or far away from the sun in a space simulator)
- Crosshair: Adds crosshair to make focussing objects with mouse easier
- Macros: Hold mouse pressed, repeat mouse clicks, or keys to automate game actions and enable afk gaming
- Enables you to change audio device settings

How it works:
- As overlays it does not change the current foreground window when using the hud
- Invisible Mode (No Taskbar, No Task Icon)
- Mouse Input or Key Control if mouse is captured by game
- HUD is rendered on seconday display if available
- HUD can be interacted using secondary display with touch screen without changing current foreground window
- Marcos are written in LUA - UI is a fully interactive IDE, scripts will be loaded if you save them

What's good?
- GUD is a simple App without any services
- It's low on memory, gpu and gpu resources
- It's easy to use and unobtrustive in different game environments
- Pixel Perfect Crosshairs
